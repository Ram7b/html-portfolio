    <h3>Work Experience :</h3>
    <h4>3 months internship In Machine Learning </h4>
    <p>After successfully completing the three-month internship program in Machine Learning at IIT Mandi in collaboration with AISECT, I gained hands-on experience in various aspects of machine learning, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. During this period, I worked on real-world projects, collaborating with experts and fellow interns to implement machine learning algorithms using Python and libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. This internship allowed me to deepen my understanding of both supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning techniques. Additionally, I enhanced my problem-solving skills and learned how to handle complex datasets efficiently. The mentorship from experienced professionals at IIT Mandi was invaluable in shaping my career aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
